# Math Expressions interpreter 
## General Information
this program represents nested logical expressions with variables, evaluates their values
for specific variable assignments, and simplifies the results.

Basically, it's a program that interprets logical expressions.
It can be used for:

* Automatically differentiate and simplify expressions using logic gates.
* Evaluate expressions.
* Get expression's variables.
* Performs procedures on the expression such as - nandify, norify, etc.


```
Expression e = new Not(
                  new Xor(
                     new And(
                        new Val(true),
                        new Or(
                           new Var("x"),
                           new Var("y")
                        )
                     ),
                     new Var("x")
                  )
               );
```
the "tree" of the expression will look like:

<br>in this project i worked with the following UML diagram to compute the expressions.

## Examples
First,The string representations are as follows:
* And(x,y) = (x & y)
* Or(x,y) = (x | y)
* Xor(x,y) = (x ^ y)
* Nand(x,y) = (x A y)
* Nor(x,y) = (x V y)
* Xnor(x,y) = (x # y)
* Not(x) = ~(x)

here we can see the code example: 
![](images/CodeExample.png)
<br> 
we compute the expression ((x and y) or (z xor t))
<br> 
when the assignment of the variables are x=true, y=false, z=false, t=false.
and then we compute the nandify and norify form of the expression and at the end we simplify the expression if we can.
<br>
the result is

## Setup
### Option 1 - Without Ant
1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/EtaiWil/Math_Expressions_Interpreter.git
```
2. Open the project from an IDE such as Intellij, Eclipse, etc.
3. Make sure an updated JDK is set in the configuration, and the src folder of Math-Expressions-Interpreter is set as the source root.
4. Create a configuration with ExpressionsTest as the Main Class, run it, and enjoy!

### Option 2 - With Ant
1. Clone the repository:
  ```
git clone https://github.com/EtaiWil/Math_Expressions_Interpreter.git
```
2. Install [Apache Ant](https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi)

   if you're having difficulties with the Ant installation proccess, you can click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watchv=3eaW81yYIqY&t=353s&ab_channel=xscourse) for help.

<br /> 

3. Open CMD in the cloned directory and run this command:
    ```
    ant run
    ```
